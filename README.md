## Introduction

This Playwright framework provides fast, reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation, supporting **Chromium**, **Firefox**, and **WebKit**. It is especially suited for testing complex web applications.

For more detailed information on the basics of Playwright, visit the [**Introduction Guide**](Guides/FrameworkIntroduction.md).

## Setup

Before starting with Playwright, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

-   **Node.js** (version 12 or higher)
-   **npm** or **yarn**

Install Playwright using the following command:

```bash
npm install playwright
```

You can also install specific browser engines:

```bash
npm install playwright-chromium
npm install playwright-firefox
npm install playwright-webkit
```

To set up a Playwright project, run the following command:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

For detailed setup instructions and environment configurations, refer to the [Setup Guide](Guides/Introduction.md).

## Guides

### TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier Setup

Writing consistent, well-formatted code is essential for maintaining a clean codebase. This section of the guide walks you through setting up **TypeScript** with **ESLint** and **Prettier** for your Playwright project.

By following this guide, you'll:

-   Configure ESLint to identify problematic patterns in your TypeScript code.
-   Use Prettier to ensure consistent code formatting.
-   Create scripts to automate linting and code formatting.

For a detailed guide, refer to [ESLint and Prettier Setup Guide](/Guides/esLintAndPretty.md).

### Writing and Running Playwright Tests

Once your Playwright environment is set up, it's time to start writing tests. Playwright enables you to write tests using **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** and run them across multiple browser engines with minimal configuration.

In this guide, you'll learn:

-   How to write basic Playwright tests.
-   Test structure and best practices.
-   Running Playwright tests locally and in CI environments.

For detailed instructions, visit [Playwright Test Guide](/Guides/Introduction.md) (to be created as an example).
